# Other Animations

This package provides material design style animations and transitions.

It's not meant to be used directly, but through [MotionSwitcher](https://github.com/volskaya/motion_switcher.flutter) package, that provides simple widgets that let you easily implement these animations into your apps.

_This is a fork of [animations](https://github.com/flutter/packages/tree/main/packages/animations) with adjusted widgets, timings, callbacks, etc._
